# GPT-2 Demo IN PROGRESS

A two-part demonstration of GPT-2 as a creative tool:

1. A twitter bot trained on over 40,000 tweets from the @realDonaldTrump Twitter Account
2. A [companion podcast](https://soundcloud.com/user-545533369/on-computational-creative-assists) where three Columbia University experts and I tackle GPT-2 as a creative assists for artists. We discuss the origins of mathematic-induced inspiration and dissect the output of GPT-2 on air.

 Current steps:

1. Used https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce as guide for training of both sophie's model and the donald trump tweets model. Unfortunately, I do not have a GPU.

All GPT-2 training for this demo was performed on a Python 3 Google Colab notebook using the [GPT-2-simple](https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple) library developed by [Max Woolf](https://minimaxir.com/). If you like what I did here, Max made it possible. So, consider donating to his [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/minimaxir) so he can help people make more cool stuff.
